    <h1>Privacy Policy for Wattage Calculator</h1>

    <p>At Wattage Calculator, we take your privacy seriously. This privacy policy outlines how we handle the information that you provide while using our app. <strong>We do not collect, store, or share any personal data from our users.</strong></p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>Wattage Calculator is designed to function entirely offline. This means that any data you input, such as appliance usage, energy costs, or calculations, remains stored locally on your device. We do not collect, transmit, or store any information on external servers. The app does not require any form of registration, and you are not asked to provide any personal information such as your name, email address, or location.</p>

    <h2>2. Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All the information entered into the app, including appliance details and calculation results, is kept only on your device. We do not have access to any of this information, and none of it is uploaded or shared with third parties. You may choose to save or delete the data locally at your own discretion.</p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Wattage Calculator does not use any third-party services that may track or collect user data. There are no analytics tools, advertising services, or social media plugins embedded in this app.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, the security of your data depends on your device’s security measures, such as passwords, encryption, or biometric security. We recommend ensuring your device is secured to protect your information.</p>

    <h2>5. User Control</h2>
    <p>You have full control over the data within the app. You can delete or reset your calculations at any time. No data is sent to us or any third parties, so you don’t need to contact us to request data deletion.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in this document, and the updated version will be available within the app. We encourage users to review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect their privacy.</p>
